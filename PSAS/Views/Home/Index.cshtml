<h1>Welcome to Pierre's Bad Bakery: Sweets Division!</h1>
<h2>Pierre has totally lost his shit because they have changed the retirement age to 64 in France.  Now, at the age of 61, he had to change some plans.  Instead of trying to keep his bakery emblimatic and representational of France's deep cultural traditions; he has decided to betray all of that and be spiteful.  Anyway, currently he has decided that his bakery was too focused on the complex carbs.  He's decide he need to join the youth and "go pro" by increasing the addictiveness of his product.  He watched youtube sell out by becoming more like tik toc to addict customers, he decided he better get with the future or get left behind.  He's opened up his sweets division to poison the population with addictive sugary sweets.  Here is the new Website so he can be more effective at causing mass diabetes.  </h2>
